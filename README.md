### **a)The Data Analytic Question**

>Based on who's home and who's away, and whether or not the game is friendly, what will be the predicted results of a game between team 1 and team 2?
>### **b)Metric for Success**

> Approach 1: Polynomial approach
Be able to Predict how many goals the home team scores. Be able to Predict how many goals the away team scores.

> Approach 2: Logistic approach
Feature Engineering: Figure out from the home teamâ€™s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw.

> For our analysis to be considered successful, we must be able to:

1.Perform explorative data analysis.

2.Create a prediction model with high accuracy.

3.Predict how many goals the home team and the away team scores.

4.Predict whether from the home team's perspective, the game is a Win, Lose or Draw.
### **c)Understanding The Context
FIFA produced the inaugural ranking of its men's member associations in December 1992 to offer a framework for comparing the relative strengths of these teams.

 Historical rankings records, such as those found on FIFA.com, reflect the method of calculation in use at the time, as the new technique has not been applied retroactively to rankings prior to July 2006. Since the rankings began, FIFA's membership has grown from 167 to 211, with 210 members currently included in the rankings.

 FIFA uses the rankings to rate the progress and existing capabilities of its member nations' national football teams, claiming that they provide "a valid metric for comparing national A-teams."They are used to seed tournaments as part of the calculation or as the complete grounds.

 The rankings are also used to choose the winners of two annual awards given to national teams based on their rankings performance.

One of the factors for player work permits used by the (English) Football Association is the average of the previous 24 months' rankings.
### **(Experimental Design)**

> These are the steps to be followed during the analysis:


1.Defining the Question

2.Data preparation

3.Data Cleaning

4.Merging the Dataframes

5.Performing EDA

6.Prediction Models

7.Checking accuracy for our models

8.Challenging the solution and conclusion
